**Project Summary:**
We have built a pipeline that utilizes social media data to identify trends about products in the kitchenware and houseware industry.
The data was collected through a third party TikTok API and audio recognition python packages, cleanses, and transforms text data with NLP techniques, and detects trends through time series analysis.

The methodology was deployed to identify social media trends to be included in a dashboard for product managers. Product managers can explore analysis results, extract insights and make new product development decisions backed by social media data. This analysis showcases viral or potential trends and is crucial for the client company's negotiation with partner vendors.


**Code Files:**
Included are 5 coding files in which can be used to guide any developer looking to replicate our methodology. Coding files are heavily commented for clarity.

**User Guide:**
A user guide was created for a less complicated analytics translation. Our sponsors development team were encouraged to integrate our pipeline within their ecosystem using our user guide.
